  # You can override the default logic that is used to autogenerate the item ids.
  # To do this, define a Proc which takes the key of the current item as argument.
  # The example below would add a prefix to each key.
  # navigation.id_generator = Proc.new {|key| "my-prefix-#{key}"}

  # If you need to add custom html around item names, you can define a proc that

  # Define the admin navigation
  navigation.items do |admin|
    # Add an item to the admin navigation. The following params apply:
    # key - a symbol which uniquely defines your navigation item in the scope of the primary_navigation
    # name - will be displayed in the rendered navigation. This can also be a call to your I18n-framework.
    # url - the address that the generated item links to. You can also use url_helpers (named routes, restful routes helper, url_for etc.)
    # options - can be used to specify attributes that will be included in the rendered navigation item (e.g. id, class etc.)
    #           some special options that can be set:
    #           :if - Specifies a proc to call to determine if the item should
    #                 be rendered (e.g. <tt>if: -> { current_user.admin? }</tt>). The
    #                 proc should evaluate to a true or false value and is evaluated in the context of the view.
    #           :unless - Specifies a proc to call to determine if the item should not
    #                     be rendered (e.g. <tt>unless: -> { current_user.admin? }</tt>). The
    #                     proc should evaluate to a true or false value and is evaluated in the context of the view.
    #           :method - Specifies the http-method for the generated link - default is :get.
    #           :highlights_on - if autohighlighting is turned off and/or you want to explicitly specify
    #                            when the item should be highlighted, you can set a regexp which is matched
    #                            against the current URI.  You may also use a proc, or the symbol <tt>:subpath</tt>.

    admin.item :settings, 'General',  settings_path , html: { icon: 'gear' }
    admin.item :settings, 'Users',  users_path , html: { icon: 'users' }

    # Add an item which has a sub navigation (same params, but with block)
    # admin.item :key_2, 'name', url, options do |sub_nav|
      # Add an item to the sub navigation (same params again)
      # sub_nav.item :key_2_1, 'name', url, options
    # end

    # You can also specify a condition-proc that needs to be fullfilled to display an item.
    # Conditions are part of the options. They are evaluated in the context of the views,
    # thus you can use all the methods and vars you have available in the views.
    # admin.item :key_3, 'Admin', url, class: 'special', if: -> { current_user.admin? }
    # admin.item :key_4, 'Account', url, unless: -> { logged_in? }
